International business-cycle models struggle to match aggregate output  correlations between countries observed in the data. New Trade models with an active extensive margin of trade have been proposed as a way of generating a positive association between correlation and trade intensity, but it remains an open question whether or not these models can match the levels of correlation. In this paper, I revisit this problem with an explicit comparison between Old and New Trade and their predictions for comovement. I provide tractable expressions for the second moments of sectoral and aggregate output in the two most common static frameworks of International Trade while allowing for an arbitrary number of countries, sectors and input-output linkages. In the symmetric case, I show that the correlation expressions are almost identical across frameworks, their differences converge sublinearly to zero in the number of countries, and that trade and input elasticities are the crucial parameters in matching the data. I calibrate the models using world input-output data and I find that Old Trade under-predicts the correlation of GDP by an order of magnitude, while New Trade predicts correlations between one-fifth and one-half of those observed in the data and helps solve the puzzles quantitatively.
